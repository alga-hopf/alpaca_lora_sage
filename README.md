# Alpaca-LoRA-SageMath

This repository contains the code to fine-tune the Stanford Alpaca model with low rank adaptation on a dataset made of SageMath instructions. SageMath is a popular free open-source mathematical software, whose mission is ''Creating a viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica and Matlab''. Following their mission, it would be helpful to have a language assistant specialized in the SageMath language for different purposes, like research, education, or as free and open source plugin for language assistants.
